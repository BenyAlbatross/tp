### Updating an application: `update`

Use this command to update any field (company, role, deadline, pay, status) of an internship application.  


<div style="background-color: #331c16; color: #c3b091; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #966919;">
<h4><strong>Valid <code>STATUS</code> values</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Pending</code> - You’re considering the internship but haven’t applied yet.</li>
<li><code>Interested</code> - You’ve found the internship and might apply.</li>
<li><code>Applied</code> - You’ve submitted your application.</li>
<li><code>Interviewing</code> - You’re currently in the interview process.</li>
<li><code>Offer</code> - You’ve received an internship offer.</li>
<li><code>Accepted</code> - You’ve accepted the offer.</li>
<li><code>Rejected</code> - The application was unsuccessful or withdrawn.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Format:

```
update INDEX field1/VALUE1 field2/VALUE2 ...
```

Example:

```
update 1 status/Accepted
update 2 company/Microsoft status/Interviewing
```

The 1st command updates the status of the internship application at index 1 to "Accepted".

The 2nd command updates the company of the internship application at index 2 to "Microsoft" and its status to "Interviewing".

<div style="background-color: #331c16; color: #c3b091; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #966919;">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>For v1.0, only the <code>status</code> field can be updated. Updating other fields (company, role, deadline, pay) will be added in
future iterations.</li>
<li>All field values must adhere to the constraints specified in the <code>add</code> feature.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Listing all applications: `list`

Use this command to view all internship applications.  
By default, the list shows applications in the **order they were added**.
You can optionally sort them by deadline in ascending or descending order.

Format:

```
list
list sort/ORDER
```

Example:

```
list
list sort/asc
list sort/desc
```

- `list` → shows all applications in the order they were added
- `list sort/asc` → sorts applications by deadline ascending
- `list sort/desc` → sorts applications by deadline descending

---

### Finding by keyword: `find`

Search for internship applications by keyword. The search is case-insensitive.

Format:

```
find KEYWORD
```

Example:

```
find Software Engineer
```

This command lists all internship applications that contain the keyword "Software Engineer" in either its company or
role details.

---

Use this command to set or change the username for the Internity application.

Format:

```
username USERNAME
```

Example:

```
username Yoshikage Kira

and a breakdown of internships by status.
